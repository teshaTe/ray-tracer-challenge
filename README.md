# ray-tracer-challenge
Ray-tracer challenge based on the book http://raytracerchallenge.com

### *status*: development

## Project description:

This is my pure C++ (CPU only) implementation of the ray tracer. I am slowly working on this project in my spare time.
At the moment it is possible to render a simple 3D sphere with simple Phong material. 


## TODO list:
- Finish CPU-based implementation;
- Add GUI;
- Add GPU-based implementation (CUDA or VulkanAPI);
